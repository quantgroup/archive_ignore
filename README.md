# laplace_breadth
Pre-calculation data manipulation, the calculation and the post-calculation data manipulation for the Laplace breadth factor.

## Aim

I would really like some early feedback and direction from everyone on the team so that you are onboard with my library stack, methodology and underlying philosophy. This is so that I have to do as little irrelevant or unusable work as possible, and can learn the correct technologies and procedures early on.

## Layout
### Pre-calc

pre-calculation data manipulation. Requirements.txt file contains a frozen image of the used libraries in the virtual environment.

### Rationale doc

Factor rationale and calculation function rationale for future reference. Performace functions tend to sacrifice readability.
